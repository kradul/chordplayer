chordplayer
===========

Chordplayer is a lightweight Javascript-based webpage designed to help with harmonic ear training.

It plays random chords in a key and then names the function of the chord, allowing the user to guess what chord it is and then immediately get feedback.

This project was motivated by my desire to develop my harmonic listening skills without having to devote my full attention to a program. Many other websites have harmonic ear training programs, but they usually require the user to interact with the page, for example to submit a guess of the chord's identity or to move on to the next exercise. Chordplayer lets a user multitask while developing their ear training skills. You can be taking a walk or washing the dishes and learning to recognize chords!
